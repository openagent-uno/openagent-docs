# Apps & Distribution

OpenAgent is not a single installer. It is a **model-agnostic agent system** with four access surfaces: one hosted Web App plus three independent apps that are released together but installed separately.

Most setups look like this:

1. Install the **Agent Server** on the machine that should keep the agent running.
2. Open the hosted **Web App**, install the **CLI Client**, or install the **Desktop App** on the machine where you want to control that agent.
3. Point every client at the same OpenAgent Gateway.

## 1. Agent Server

This is the actual OpenAgent runtime in `openagent/`.

- Runs the model provider, MCP tools, memory, channels, scheduler, and auto-update flow
- Available as a **standalone executable** (no Python required) or as a pip package (`openagent-framework`)
- Lives on the machine where the agent should run continuously
- Supports multiple independent agents via agent directories

Typical install (standalone executable):

```bash
# Download from GitHub Releases, extract, then:
./openagent serve ./my-agent
```

Or via pip:

```bash
pip install openagent-framework[all]
openagent serve
```

## 2. CLI Client

This is the terminal client for talking to a running OpenAgent server.

- Installs as `openagent-cli`
- Connects to any OpenAgent Gateway over WebSocket
- Useful for ops, remote access, and low-friction local usage

Typical install:

```bash
pip install openagent-cli
openagent-cli connect localhost:8765 --token mysecret
```

## 3. Desktop App

This is the Electron app for chat, memory browsing, graph exploration, MCP configuration, and settings.

- Distributed as platform-specific binaries on GitHub Releases
- Connects to a running Agent Server
- Does not replace the server install

## 4. Web App

This is the browser build of the same React Native app that powers the Desktop App.

- Hosted at [openagent.uno/app](https://openagent.uno/app/) — no install required
- Built from `app/universal/` via `expo export --platform web` and deployed by the `Deploy Docs` GitHub Actions workflow alongside the documentation site
- Connects to a running Agent Server exactly like the Desktop App
- Useful when you want the OpenAgent UI on a device where installing a native binary is inconvenient (shared workstations, tablets, quick demos)

## Distribution Model

- Tagged GitHub releases are the shared download point for the three installable apps.
- The Agent Server is attached as **standalone executables** (macOS, Linux, Windows) and Python package artifacts.
- The CLI Client is attached as Python package artifacts.
- The Desktop App is attached as macOS, Windows, and Linux installers.
- The standalone executable self-updates from GitHub Releases automatically (no pip needed).
- The pip-installed version auto-updates via `pip install --upgrade`.
- The Web App is published continuously to GitHub Pages from the `main` branch, so `openagent.uno/app` always reflects the latest source.
- The [Downloads](../downloads.md) page resolves the newest available GitHub asset for each installable app separately, so one missing artifact family does not hide the others.

## Multi-Agent

The Agent Server supports running multiple independent agents in parallel. Each agent runs from its own **agent directory** containing all data:

```
my-agent/
├── openagent.yaml    # config (models, MCPs, channels)
├── openagent.db      # SQLite database (tasks, usage)
├── memories/         # Memory vault (markdown notes)
└── logs/             # Log files
```

Start agents from different directories:
```bash
./openagent serve ./agent-work
./openagent serve ./agent-home
```

Ports are auto-allocated to avoid conflicts. Each agent registers as a separate OS service with a unique name derived from its directory.

## Model-Agnostic Behavior

OpenAgent keeps the same operating surface across providers:

- Same MCP tools
- Same memory behavior
- Same channels and scheduler
- Same clients

Changing the model should not change how the system is operated.
