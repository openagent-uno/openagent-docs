# Gateway

The Gateway is OpenAgent's public interface — a WebSocket + REST server that lives **inside the AgentServer process**. Every client (desktop app, CLI, Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp bridges) talks to the agent through it.

Unlike a traditional HTTP server listening on a TCP port, the Gateway is served over **Iroh QUIC** (a P2P transport). Clients don't connect to `localhost:8765` — they connect to the agent's Iroh NodeId, authenticated by a coordinator-signed device certificate.

## Authentication

The Gateway uses **device certificate authentication**, not bearer tokens or shared secrets. Every inbound connection carries a coordinator-signed certificate that binds a user handle to a device public key.

The `NetworkAuthState` middleware runs on every request:
1. Extract the cert wire bytes from the Iroh stream
2. Verify the Ed25519 signature against the pinned coordinator public key
3. Check the cert hasn't expired (30-day TTL)
4. Check the cert is for this network (`network_id` match)
5. Check the device hasn't been revoked (`network_devices.status = 'active'`)
6. Annotate the request with `device_cert`, `client_id`, and `user_handle`

Failed auth returns `401 unauthorized`. Unlike the legacy shared-token model, each device has its own credential — revoking one device doesn't affect others for the same user.

See [Invitation System & Networking](./invitation-system.md) for the full cert lifecycle and coordinator architecture.

## WebSocket protocol

All traffic on `/ws` is JSON. The protocol uses typed messages for both directions.

### Client → Server

| Type | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `auth` | `{token, client_id}` | Handshake (legacy: now cert-based, but still present for bridges) |
| `session_open` | `{session_id}` | Open or resume a conversation session |
| `text_final` | `{text, session_id, attachments?}` | Send a user turn to the agent |
| `audio_chunk_in` | `{session_id, data: base64, seq, is_end}` | Voice mode audio input |
| `attachment` | `{session_id, path, filename, type}` | Attach a file to the current turn |
| `interrupt` | `{session_id}` | Interrupt the current agent run |
| `command` | `{name: stop\|clear\|new\|reset\|…, session_id}` | Slash-command equivalents |
| `ping` | `{}` | Keep-alive |

### Server → Client

| Type | Payload | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `auth_ok` | `{agent_name, version}` | Handshake accepted |
| `auth_error` | `{reason}` | Handshake rejected |
| `delta` | `{text, session_id}` | Streaming token during generation |
| `status` | `{text, session_id}` | Tool-use progress (e.g. the agent's `ToolExecution` JSON) — **data**, not a UI string |
| `reasoning` | `{active, session_id}` | Boolean "the agent is thinking" flag. The server never ships a `"Thinking…"` UI string — each client renders its own affordance (native typing indicator, CLI spinner, app animation). `active=true` while thinking, `false` once output starts or the turn ends |
| `response` | `{text, session_id, model, attachments}` | Final agent reply for a turn |
| `turn_complete` | `{session_id, usage}` | Turn finished, includes cost/token info |
| `queued` | `{position}` | Message accepted, waiting in FIFO queue |
| `pong` | `{}` | Keep-alive ack |
| `audio_start` / `audio_chunk` / `audio_end` | `{session_id, …}` | TTS audio streaming |
| `resource_event` | `{resource, action, id}` | Broadcast on MCP/vault/task/config mutations |
| `system_snapshot` | `{cpu_percent, ram_percent, disk_percent}` | System health broadcast |
| `error` | `{text}` | Recoverable error |
| `command_result` | `{text}` | Response to a slash command |

### Attachments

Attachments use markers in reply text (`[IMAGE:/path]`, `[FILE:/path]`, `[VOICE:/path]`, `[VIDEO:/path]`) which the gateway strips and moves into the structured `attachments` array with `{type, path, filename}` entries.

## Session management

The Gateway owns a `SessionManager` that enforces **one active run per client** (`client_id` = device pubkey hex) with a FIFO queue. Messages arriving while a turn is in flight get an immediate `queued` acknowledgement with position, then stream `status` events until `response` arrives. An `interrupt` command cancels the active run.

Sessions are isolated — each `session_id` maps to its own conversation history. Bridges use platform-specific session IDs (e.g. `tg:155490357` for Telegram), while the desktop app and CLI use arbitrary strings. Session bindings (which model served this session) persist in SQLite across restarts.

## REST API

All endpoints live under `/api/` on the same aiohttp application. Every request is authenticated via device cert middleware (except `/api/health` which may bypass for liveness checks).

## Bridges

Bridges (Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp) are internal WebSocket clients that connect to the gateway over Iroh within the same process. They translate platform SDK events into the unified WS protocol. Each bridge is configured with platform-specific tokens and allowed-user lists in `openagent.yaml`.

The `BaseBridge` class (~150 lines) handles connection lifecycle, retry, and session mapping. Adding a new platform means subclassing `BaseBridge` — the core agent code never changes. See [Channels](./channels.md) for per-platform configuration.

## Loopback proxy

The desktop app and CLI client don't speak Iroh directly in all cases. Instead, a **loopback proxy** bridges localhost TCP to the agent's gateway over Iroh QUIC:

```
App/CLI ←→ localhost:PORT ←→ LoopbackProxy ←→ Iroh QUIC ←→ Agent Gateway
```

The proxy presents the device cert on every Iroh stream and translates between plain HTTP/WS on the local side and authenticated Iroh streams on the remote side. This lets standard HTTP clients (fetch, curl, WebSocket browser APIs) work without Iroh integration.
