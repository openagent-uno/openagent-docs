# Example `openagent.yaml`

This is the sanitized production-style example shipped with the repository. LLM providers (API keys, base URLs) and the per-provider model catalog live in SQLite, not in this file — manage them via the `mcp-manager` / `model-manager` built-in MCPs, the `/api/providers`, `/api/mcps`, and `/api/models/db` REST endpoints, or the desktop/CLI UI.

::: tip Multi-Agent Mode
When using agent directories (`openagent serve ./my-agent`), this file lives at `./my-agent/openagent.yaml` alongside the database, memories, and logs. The `memory.db_path` and `memory.vault_path` fields are optional — they default to the agent directory. Each agent directory is fully self-contained.

```yaml
# OpenAgent example configuration.
#
# LLM providers (API keys, base URLs) and the per-provider model
# catalog live in SQLite, not in this file. Manage them via:
#
#   - the ``mcp-manager`` and ``model-manager`` built-in MCPs (the agent
#     itself can call their tools to add/remove/toggle entries);
#   - the REST API — ``/api/providers/*``, ``/api/mcps/*``, and
#     ``/api/models/db/*``;
#   - the desktop app's Settings screens and the CLI's ``/mcps`` /
#     ``/models`` / ``openagent provider`` commands.
#
# This yaml is the source of truth for ``channels``, ``memory`` paths,
# ``dream_mode``, ``auto_update``, ``system_prompt``, ``name``, and the
# ``model:`` routing block.
#
# Any value in the form ${VAR_NAME} is substituted from environment
# variables at load time.

# Keep this short. Identity + pointer to the memory vault is enough —
# OpenAgent prepends a framework-level system prompt that already covers
# how to use the vault (mcpvault tools, wikilinks, frontmatter), MCP-vs-
# shell preference, acting autonomously, and concise output style. Put
# project-specific details (package names, app IDs, host names, procedures)
# INSIDE the memory vault as .md notes — the agent will find them with
# `search_notes`.
system_prompt: |
  You are My Agent, the persistent AI assistant for My Project.

  Your memory vault is at ~/.openagent/memories/. All project identity,
  credentials, infrastructure, procedures and contacts are documented
  there as notes. Search the vault first before answering any factual
  question about the project.

model:
  # The active runtime is always the SmartRouter. It reads enabled
  # models from the ``models`` DB table and dispatches each session to
  # either an Agno provider or the Claude CLI (via the internal
  # registry) based on a small classifier + session-side binding.
  # Sessions cannot cross: once a session has been served by one side
  # (agno or claude-cli), subsequent turns stay there.
  permission_mode: bypass         # auto-approve tool calls (agent deployments)
  monthly_budget: 0               # 0 disables budget guardrails

  # Optional explicit routing. Leave empty to auto-derive from the
  # enabled models in the DB (sorted by output cost per million).

# LLM provider credentials (API keys, base URLs) and the per-provider
# model catalog live in the ``providers`` and ``models`` SQLite tables.
# Add/remove/toggle them via the ``model-manager`` MCP, the
# ``/api/providers`` and ``/api/models/db`` REST endpoints, the
# ``openagent provider`` CLI, or the desktop app's Settings screen.
#
# MCP servers used to live here as a ``mcp:`` list. They now live in
# the ``mcps`` SQLite table. On upgrade, any pre-existing yaml entries
# are imported ONCE into the DB; after that the yaml block is ignored
# and edits must go through the ``mcp-manager`` MCP, ``/api/mcps``, or
# the desktop/CLI MCPs screen.
